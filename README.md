Just a simple little thing that takes whatever is on your clipboard and enters it as keystrokes.
When run in conjunction with Capture2Text (https://sourceforge.net/projects/capture2text/), it can beat those pesky typing speed tests! 

Directions for use:
Launch Capture2Text, disable "show popup window"
Launch Copy2Keystroke
Go to https://www.livechat.com/typing-speed-test/#/
Click the C2K "Start" button
Return to the speed test and click on the text field 
Press win+Q (default C2T hotkeys) and drag the box over the text to be copied, click to copy
Impress all your friends with your blistering typing speed!

N.B. Try to capture the text when the flashing cursor isn't visible as it might mess with the captured text and always remember to turn it off after use!
